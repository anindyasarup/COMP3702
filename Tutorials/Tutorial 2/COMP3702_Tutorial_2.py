# # Tutorial 2

# Let us recall the components we need for an agent.
#     - Action Space (A)
#     - Percept Space (P) 
#     - State Space (S)
#     - Transition Function (T : S x A -> S')
#     - Utility Function (U: R -> R)
# 
# We know the problem is fully observable, thus the percept space is the same
# as the state space and we dont need to do anything special while
# considering it. For BFS and DFS problems there is no cost associated with
# actions, the utility will therefore become 1 for reaching the goal state
# and 0 otherwise.
# 
# That leaves us with action space, state space, and transition function.
# 
# In the 8-puzzle game there are 4 actions that are available to us, Up,
# Right, Down, Left. These 4 actions make up the action space, the actions
# are not all always available, however we will worry about that when getting
# to the transition function.
# 
# The transition function is the core of the problem, given a state and an
# action we need a way to find the next state. The implementation for this
# will largely depend on the state space, so lets start with that.
#   

# Lets start by defining the state space in terms of python code, there are a
# few things we will be interested in. - The grid layout - what numbers are
# in what positions, we will treat this as a list, however there are a number
# of ways we can model it - The children of each state - Is the cell visited
# or not - What action led to here
# 
# Well also keep track of the cost, this is not needed for BFS and DFS,
# however is very important when we get to UCS.
# 
# Too keep track of all these properties, lets start by defining a class.
# Well also import the queue class and the heapq class, well need it later.

class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.grid = []
        self.children = []
        self.parent = None
        self.previous_action = ""
        self.cost = 0


# Next, still in our class we can define the transition function, we need to
# do 2 things here. Firstly we need to check that the action given is valid,
# and second we need to perform the action.
# 
# We can check if the action is valid by getting the current index of the
# tile. We know that the action Left is invalid in the left row, and we also
# know that the left row has elements 0, 3 and 6 in out Node.grid list,
# hence if the tile index is in one of those positions, the action Left is
# impossible.
# 
# While we are making children, we can also keep track of the childs parent
# and the action that led to the child.

# This is all the basics we need for our state and transition components. Now
# we need to perform our search.

# For testing, lets create an initial state and a goal state.

# Well also start with BFS, so well need to create a queue, and well put our
# initial state into it.
# 
# Well also need some way to keep track of states that were already visited,

# Thats the core od BFS, to change it to DFS, we just have to recall that DFS
# uses a stack, so we would switch over the queue in the code above to a
# stack and were done.

# The Last part is to convert our BFS code to UCS. The difference here is
# that UCS keeps track of the cost of actions. We are given that the cost of
# actions is {Up=1, Down=2, Left=3, Right=4}. In other words, going up 4
# times holds the same weight as going right once. We are no longer concerned
# with minimizing the number of moves, instead we want to minimize the cost.
# 
# In our Node class above we keep track of the aggregate cost from the start
# position to each new state. To make use of this we will use a priority
# queue (heapq), which takes elements out that have the smallest cost.
